# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 14th September, 2016

Test out my development environment is working.  For the exercises I will be using Spacemacs, a community configuration for Emacs that also provides a comprehensive set of Vim states (Evil mode) that make editing code more effective.

Spacemacs is configured to use the Clojure layer, which pulls in CIDER packages, providing a comprehensive Clojure development environment that is equivalent to the features of an IDE without the resource requirements.

I will use Spacemacs for all coding and documentation for this 100 days challenge.  Along the way I will document my usage of Spacemacs and useful practices in the online guide: [Practicalli Spacemacs](https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs).


### Today's Progress
As today is just a check of my environment, then no progress to report yet.

### Thoughts
I am a little nervous about this challenge as it will demonstrate just how much coding skill I currently have. My imposter syndome is kicking in a little as I think about it.  However, the excitement of emersing myself in Clojure coding for 100 days is over-riding this nervousness and hopefully this will continue to the end of the challenge.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
